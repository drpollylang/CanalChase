Feedback after demo'ing paper prototype and first working prototype of canal/movable player/autonomous pursuer (workshop session 06/02/2025):

## I really like:

- Endless loop map
- Vector mechanics on the chaser

## I was confused about:

- Understanding the lock system
- How does the game end? How do you win? Do you gain points, or is there an end point that you must reach to win?
  - Is it a loop you go around infinitely?
  - Do you reach a certain point and level up to a new map? 

## One thing I suggest to improve is:

- Having a point system to get power-ups from the chandlery
- Potential improvements to canal boat purchasable at the chandlery? Make it faster? Turbo charge?
- Potentially basing maps on real canal systems?
- Lock mechanics - is water level change triggered by a player input (key-mashing/moving over an icon?) or does it occur at a pre-defined rate automatically? Should the rate of water level change be constant/vary across different locks/incorporate a random element?
- Currents in the lock?
